                    <p>
                      This benchmark simulates the gravitational forces acting
                      on a galactic cluster using the Barnes-Hut <i>n</i>-body
                      algorithm [1]. The positions and velocities of
                      the <i>n</i> galaxies are initialized according to the
                      empirical Plummer model. The program calculates the motion
                      of each galaxy through space for a number of time
                      steps. The data parallelism in this algorithm arises
                      primarily from the independent force calculations.

                    <h1>Algorithm</h1>
                    <p>
                      Barnes-Hut's force-calculation algorithm employs a
                      hierarchical data structure, called an octree, to
                      approximately compute the force (e.g., gravitational,
                      electric, or magnetic force) that the <i>n</i> bodies in
                      the system induce upon each other. With <i>n</i> bodies,
                      O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) interactions need to be
                      considered, i.e., the precise calculation is quadratic in
                      the number of bodies. The Barnes-Hut algorithm
                      hierarchically partitions the volume around the <i>n</i>
                      bodies into successively smaller cells.  Each cell forms
                      an internal node of the octree and summarizes information
                      about the bodies it contains, in particular their combined
                      mass and center of gravity.  The leaves of the octree are
                      the individual bodies.  This hierarchy reduces the time to
                      calculate the force on the <i>n</i> bodies to O(<i>n</i>
                      log <i>n</i>) because, for cells that are sufficiently far
                      away, it suffices to perform only one force calculation
                      with the cell instead of performing one calculation with
                      every body inside the cell.  For example, consider the
                      two-dimensional hierarchical subdivision of space in
                      Figure 1.  Sometime during the force calculation of the
                      galaxy that is the source of the arrows, the algorithm
                      will check whether the red cell's center of gravity (red
                      circle) is far enough away.  Because it is not, the code
                      proceeds to look at all subcells and performs the force
                      calculations marked by the green arrows.  When the
                      algorithm considers the orange cell, however, it will find
                      that this cell is sufficiently far away and will therefore
                      only perform one force calculation (orange arrow) and
                      will <i>not</i> look deeper into this cell (blue arrows).

                    <p>
                      In more detail, the algorithm proceeds as follows
                      (pseudocode is provided in Figure 2).  First, the list of
                      bodies is initialized with the starting location and
                      velocity of each body (line 1). Then the code iterates
                      over the time steps (line 2).  In each iteration, a new
                      octree (i.e., spatial hierarchy) is generated by inserting
                      all bodies (lines 3 - 6).  Then the cumulative mass and
                      center of mass of each cell is recursively computed (line
                      7). Next, the force acting upon each body is computed
                      (lines 8 - 10) by traversing the octree.  The traversal
                      along any path is terminated as soon as a leaf node (i.e.,
                      a body) or an internal node (i.e., a cell) that is far
                      enough away is encountered.  Finally, each body's position
                      and velocity are updated based on the computed force
                      (lines 11 - 13).

                    <h1>Data Structures</h1>
                    There are two key data structures used in Barnes-Hut:
                    <ul>
                      <li><h3>Unordered list</h3>: The bodies are stored in an
                        unordered list as they can be processed in any
                        order. Once initialized, the list does not change. Only
                        the bodies' attributes are modified in each time
                        step.</li>
                      <li><h3>Octree</h3>: The spatial hierarchy is represented
                        by an octree (the 3-dimensional equivalent of a binary
                        tree), where each node has up to eight children.  The
                        leaves of the octree correspond to individual bodies
                        whereas the internal nodes represent cells that contain
                        multiple spatially nearby bodies.</li>
                    </ul></div>

                    <div class="section">
                      <h1>Parallelism</h1>
                      <p>
                        While many phases of Barnes-Hut can be parallelized
                        (including building the octree and calculating the
                        summary information), we focus on parallelizing the
                        force-computation step, which consumes the vast majority
                        of the runtime.  The active nodes in this step are the
                        bodies. Calculating the force on each body requires
                        reading some portion of the octree, so the accessed
                        nodes form the body's neighborhood.  Because these
                        accesses are read-only, the bodies can be processed in
                        any order and in parallel, provided that a body does not
                        update its position or velocity until all force
                        computations are complete.  For data locality reasons,
                        it may be beneficial to process spatially close bodies
                        together.
