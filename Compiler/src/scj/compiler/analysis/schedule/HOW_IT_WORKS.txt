This package contains the core of the schedule analysis.

It tries to be totally independent from Wala or any other frontend. For this, it uses generics and "Managers" that provide
access to whatever underlaying "database" is used.

== TaskSchedule ==

The task schedule is a full matrix containing relations between all task variables in a task method. 

In the TaskSchedule, we use integers to represent "TaskVariables". The mapping between such an int and the "original" (e.g., wala-dependent)
object is given by the TaskScheduleManager.

The relations are computed automatixally inside the constructor of the TaskSchedule. For this, the TaskSchedule actually delegates
to the TaskScheduleManager and only provides methods to add relations to the TaskSchedule. It does not care whether those relations
make any sense, it only cares about some structural issues (e.g., don't set a relation twice, if a rel b then b inverse_rel a, relations function
(matrix) is complete).

This process gets rid of the loop contexts and compresses the partial schedule into a full task variable schedule.
