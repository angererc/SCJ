This package contains the core of the schedule analysis.

It tries to be totally independent from Wala or any other frontend. For this, it uses generics and "Managers" that provide
access to whatever underlaying "database" is used.

== TaskSchedule ==

The task schedule is a full matrix containing relations between all task variables in a task method. 

In the TaskSchedule, we use integers to represent "TaskVariables". The mapping between such an int and the "original" (e.g., wala-dependent)
object is given by the TaskScheduleManager.

The relations are computed automatixally inside the constructor of the TaskSchedule. For this, the TaskSchedule actually delegates
to the TaskScheduleManager and only provides methods to add relations to the TaskSchedule. It does not care whether those relations
make any sense, it only cares about some structural issues (e.g., don't set a relation twice, if a rel b then b inverse_rel a, relations function
(matrix) is complete).

This process gets rid of the loop contexts and compresses the partial schedule into a full task variable schedule.

== AnalysisSession ==

There is a 1:1 correspondence between task methods and a task schedule.
However, depending on context sensitivity the call graph can have many nodes that correspond to a method.
Because we don't want to loose this sensitivity we create one analysis task per call graph node and associate it with the correct task schedule
the analysis session keeps track of those

The schedule.core package is independent from the Wala stuff and even from ssa or anything. In order for this to work we use
TaskScheduleManager (esp. its subclass WalaTaskScheduleManager) to map from ssa variables to task variables and back.

== Resolving virtual schedule sites ==
The FullScheduleAnalysis also uses a special AnalysisTaskResolver to find possible tasks for a schedule site (for virtual sites). It does so by mapping the
schedule site to the corresponding ssa variable, look up the invocation site and find all possible target nodes in the call graph for that invocation site.
